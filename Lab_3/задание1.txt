There should be some text here, as I understand it. So let's use a dumpling recipe.

Ingredients:

1 chicken egg
1 onion
3 garlic cloves
Salt to taste
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
500 g all-purpose flour
250 ml water
500 g beef
500 g pork neck
Instructions:

Sift the flour into a mound. Create a crater in the top and pour the egg into it. Mix the flour from the edges to the center, gradually adding water. If you’re afraid to do this directly on the table, you can use a large, wide salad bowl; everything should work out the first time. Knead the dough until it becomes elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for half an hour; this will make it more elastic and easier to roll out.
Meanwhile, prepare the filling: cut the beef and pork into pieces, add garlic and chopped onion, and blend them into minced meat. Season with salt and pepper.
Sprinkle a large cutting board with flour and take 1/4 of the dough, rolling it out thinly. To remove excess flour, wet your hands with cold water and run them over the dough. Cut out circles of your desired size (using a special cutter or just a thin glass), place a teaspoon of filling in the center, and pinch the edges. You can leave them in this shape or bring together and pinch two edges to make a “ear.”
Boil the dumplings in a large amount of salted water or broth for 8–10 minutes.
